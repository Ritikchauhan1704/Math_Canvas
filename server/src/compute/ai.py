        f"For example: "
        f"Q. 2 + 3 * 4 "
        f"(3 * 4) => 12, 2 + 12 = 14. "

        f"1. Simple mathematical expressions like 2 + 2, 3 * 4, 5 / 6, 7 - 8, etc.: In this case, solve and return the answer in the format of a LIST OF ONE DICT [{{'expr': given expression, 'result': calculated answer}}]. "
        f"2. Set of Equations like x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, 3y + 4x = 0, 5x^2 + 6y + 7 = 12, etc.: In this case, solve for the given variable, and the format should be a COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF DICTS, with dict 1 as {{'expr': 'x', 'result': 2, 'assign': True}} and dict 2 as {{'expr': 'y', 'result': 5, 'assign': True}}. Include as many dicts as there are variables. "
        f"3. Assigning values to variables like x = 4, y = 5, z = 6, etc.: In this case, assign values to variables and return another key in the dict called {{'assign': True}}, keeping the variable as 'expr' and the value as 'result'. RETURN AS A LIST OF DICTS. "
        f"4. Analyzing Graphical Math problems, such as cars colliding, trigonometric drawings, Pythagorean theorem visuals, etc. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DIFFERENT COLORS. Return in LIST OF ONE DICT format. "
        f"5. Detecting Abstract Concepts like love, war, discovery, or quotes represented as drawings. Use the same format: {{'expr': explanation, 'result': abstract concept}}. "
        f"Analyze the equation or expression in this image and return the answer according to the rules. "
        f"Use escape characters properly like \\f → \\\\f, \\n → \\\\n. "
        f"If a variable in the expression is in this dictionary, use its value: {dict_of_vars_str}. "
        f"IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid Python list of dictionaries without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or backticks. "
       f"Use single quotes for strings. Example format: [{{'expr': '2+2', 'result': 4}}]"
